These are the documentation files for Ocean Sampling Day 2019. The metadata record for this event is published in the IMIS datasets catalogue: [OSD2019-record](https://www.vliz.be/en/imis?module=dataset&dasid=7917). The same data can be obtained as a direct download from that IMIS record, but a more annotated set of data (in particular the machine/developer-readable versions) are provided here.
Also provided via this Github space are the [OSD2014 data](https://github.com/ocean-sampling-day/OSD2014) and [OSD2018 data](https://github.com/ocean-sampling-day/OSD2018).

The documentation provided here includes

- The OSD Handbook (from 2016 still applies in 2019)
- The two sampling protocols used by OSD
- Instructions that were provided to the sampling scientists for filling in their logsheets
- The data policy, permits and procedures
