A number of 'Sample title's are present in the Environmental data but not in 'Omics and event' data of OSD2019: 
- OSD93_2019-06_1_NPL022
- OSD213_2019-06_1_NE08
- OSD220_2019-06_1_NPL022

There is no old data record of just the event data (without omics data already added) available. 
Hence, the event data associated to the missing 'Sample title's cannot be retrieved.
